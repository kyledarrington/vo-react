                My name is Kyle D. Arrington, and I’ve been talking into
                microphones from the moment I knew it was possible. With over a
                decade of performance experience and an intuitive understanding
                of storytelling, I know how to make your words resonate with
                your audience. As a Voice Actor, I strive to give an authentic,
                bold performance that people can truly connect to. As a client,
                I want you to feel your needs have been exceeded, and your time
                has been respected. In short: I deliver results, and I deliver
                them fast. Off mic, I’m an avid gamer and an all around nerd.
                I’m the type to bounce between hobbies, from coding to baking to
                learning new languages.
